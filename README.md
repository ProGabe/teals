# Intro to Computer Science (Python)
<sub>Dan Grecoe - A Microsoft Employee </sub>

This repo was put together for my first teaching experience with [Teals](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/teals/about) with  Mr. Norton from [Essex North Shore](https://essexnorthshore.org/). 

This repository is meant to help beginner Computer Science students with Python.  

## Contents

## Getting code locally

1. Create a directory on your computer. Name it anything you want, but make sure you remember it. 
2. Open a command prompt, bash, or Powershell.
3. Use the change directory (cd) command to point to the directory you created.
    - Example: `cd c:\teals`
4. Issue the following command in whatever prompt you used to create the directory.
    - `git clone https://github.com/grecoe/teals.git`
