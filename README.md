# Teals Scripts
<sub>Dan Grecoe - A Microsoft Employee </sub>

This repo was put together for my first teaching experience with [Teals](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/teals/about) with  Mr. Norton from [Essex North Shore](https://essexnorthshore.org/). 

This repository is meant to help beginner Computer Science students with Python.  

The contents are:

|Name|Type|Content|
|----------|-------------|-------------|
0_python|Directory|Introduction to basic Python programming structures and general programming.|
|1_practice|Directory|Some practice scripts for more complex Python concepts.|
|2_quiz|Directory|Python scripts that test the student on their knowledge on particular topics covered in class. <br><br>This is a work in progress and the code inside will likely not make sense to the beginner student.|
|3_programs|Directory|Contains example programs using concepts covered in class. Other programs are added for the student to learn if they choose to.|
|4_advanced|Directory|Advanced Python toopics that are not covered in the intro class, but can be useful for more advanced students (or for when I forget how to do something!).|
|questions|Directory|A place where I can answer specific questions sent to me. <br><br>Using the tab above called "Issues" you can submit questions and I will answer them as soon as I can.|
|README.md|file|This file you are reading right now.|
