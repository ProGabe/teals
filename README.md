# Teals Scripts
<sub>Dan Grecoe - A Microsoft Employee </sub>

This repo is for Mr. Nortons class. Inside this repo are python scripts and other documentation to share with the class. 

Please, if you have any questions, want to see other examples, or whatever it is, click on the tab above "Issues" and create a new one. 

There are a couple of folders here:

    Python - Basic python introduction to types and control structures
    Advanced - Advanced Python Topics
    Practice - Some deep dive practices
    Questions - Where I answer questions from the class or Issues that were opened
    (There will be more to come as the year goes on.)
