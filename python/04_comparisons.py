    Comparing values is a critical part of any programming language and Python is no exception. 

    You will have to compare things such as numbers or strings. You can do a lot of comparison 
    types, but think of math, with a coupe of differences. 

    As we saw in parameters 'var = 10', the single equal sign is used for assigning a value 
    to a parameter. Here are the table of common comparisons. 

    ==  : Equal
    !=  : Not Equal
    <   : Less than
    <=  : Less than or equal
    >   : Greater than
    >=  : Greater than or equal 

    Using numbers an booleans these make the most sense. Of course, you can use them on strings 
    and other types, but the use there becomes much more complicated. 

    NOTE: 
        The result of a comparison is a boolean value. See 1_boolean for more.
