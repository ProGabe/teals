'''
    A parameter in Python is simply some named object that contains some sort of information
    your program needs. 

    A parameter in python can hold ANY valid Python object. 

    In the example below, we use a variable called myVar and set it to various values and print them. 

    NOTE: 
    
    A couple of important things to note here, I'm going to introduce some built in Python functions. 
    It's not important to know what a function is at this point, but to understand what these are:
    
    print() : Allows you to print information to the terminal. It takes either one or several items 
              to print. For example:
                print(value1 + value2) 
                    Adds value1 and value2 and prints the results. 
                print(value1, value2)
                    Prints value1 and value2 with a space between them. 
    type() : Tells you what type of object something is

myVar = 1
print("myVar is a", type(myVar), "and the value is", myVar)
myVar = "hello"
print("myVar is a", type(myVar), "and the value is", myVar)
myVar = 1.0
print("myVar is a", type(myVar), "and the value is", myVar)
