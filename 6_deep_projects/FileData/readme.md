# File Data Application

This example shows the basics of using the file 

multi_command_utils/data_file.py

It is a simple command line application (without a menu this time) that will take read in a CSV file and perform actions on it. 

This example is used for loading all of the data files in the Formula One project and it is good to understand how it works.
