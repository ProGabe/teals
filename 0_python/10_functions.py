    Functions are a way to consolidate repetative or complex code.

    Main idea is to break down complex functionality to smaller problems. Smaller problems
    are then turned into functions. 

    Functions should be:
        1. Well named to understand what they are doing.
        2. Documented for users of the function
        3. Perform one set of actions

def pause(message = '\nEnter to continue....', clear = True):
    if message:
        input(message)
    if clear: 
        os.system('cls')

    A function is just a way to take common code and make a single copy of it.

    What is common code? 
    
    Something you call more than once in your program. 
    
    A function is defined in your file like this :

    def [functionName](parameters if any):
        <statements>"
        [return - totally optional]
''')
pause()

print( '''
    So a simple function that adds two numbers that you passed
    as parameters would be defined like this:

    def addTwoNumbers(number1, number2):
        return number1 + number2
''')

    So, how do you return something from a function?

    Use a return statement! You just saw this earlier.

    The return statment can return:

    - List
    - Dictionary

    - Single item
