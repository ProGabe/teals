# Python
<sub>Dan Grecoe - A Microsoft Employee </sub>

Python is a computer coding language that is widely used in the IT and software industries. 

Really, anywhere people are working on computers you will find the Python language. 

Python is an interpreted language. That means there is a larger program that reads a Python file (script) and executes the commands. 

Python can be run in one of two ways, but first you MUST install it on your computer. 

1. From the command line, just type the word 'python'. This will start the interpreter and you can then start entering in python commands. 
2. Executing a python script (which is really just a text file with the extension '.py')

This folder contains tutorials on things that we are covering in class. Basically the building blocks you will need to write and understand basic python scripts. 

The files are numbered to keep them in some sort of order in which you can learn. Open them up, the comments guide you through it.

## Introduction To Python Structures
Use these files, in numeric order, to walk new Python students through the basic building blocks of the language. 

Building one upon the other, by the end of this section, students should have gained a strong understanding of basic python programming.
