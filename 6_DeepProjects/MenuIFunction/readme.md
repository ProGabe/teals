# Multi Command Application Using Functions

This example builds on the 01_MultiCommand/example.py example by implementing an IFunction instance. 

The utilities utilized in this file are as follows:

multi_command_utils/interface.py
multi_command_utils/menuutils.py
multi_command_utils/multi_command_application.py

The example is a mix of standard Python functions and one implementation of the IFunction class. The IFunction derived class we will use is located in example_function.py located in this directory. 

For deeper insight on the multi_command_utils, read 

multi_command_utils/ReadMe.md
