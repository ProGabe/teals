# Student Programs
<sub>Dan Grecoe - A Microsoft Employee </sub>

This folder contains practice programs for students to hone their programming skills. 

Each file is a markdown that includes the instructions on what the student should create along with a guide at the top of the file indicating the topics from 0_python that should be read, if not mastered, before moving on to attempting the program. 

Each of these are numbered starting at 0 and the student should traverse the files in order as their skill progress.
