Create a genie program. Save the file as magic_genie.py.

1. Have the program introduce itself. Then have the program ask for three separate wishes. Finally, print all the wishes together. 
      ```
      I am a genie. You have three wishes
      What woudl you like to wish for? cats
      What woudl you like to wish for? kittens
      What woudl you like to wish for? more cats
      Your wishes are cats, kittens and more cats
      ```
2. There are some repeated strings in this genie program. Move those into variables.

3. Now it's time to make your genie confused. Edit your code to have him print your first wish as your last wish, and your second wish as your first wish, and your third wish as your second wish. 
      ```
      I am a genie. You have three wishes
      What woudl you like to wish for? cats
      What woudl you like to wish for? kittens
      What woudl you like to wish for? more cats
      Your wishes are kittens, more cats and cats
      ```
