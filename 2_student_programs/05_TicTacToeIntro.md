## Details
Create a list that represents a tic-tac-toe board. Visually, a user would see the board such as:

```
    1 | 2 | 3
    ---------
    4 | 5 | 6
    ---------
    7 | 8 | 9
```
But you will represent it in code as a list

- The user picks a location on the board according to the number: 
- Depending on the position that the user inputs, update the position of the board to an "X" to reflect that.
- Print the updated board out, but don't worry about making it look pretty.
You only need to implement one turn of the game

# Example
```
    Enter a postion on the board > 5
    [1,2,3,4,'X',6,7,8,9]
```
