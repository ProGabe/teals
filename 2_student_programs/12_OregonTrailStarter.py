    OREGON TRAIL STARTER KIT

    We will start by collecting the information we 
    need from the instructions to be succesful. 

    We will then start creating functions and testing
    them along the way. 

    Pull the repo
        If you have changes that GIT complains about, change the git pull
        call slightly to force an overwrite:
            git reset --hard origin/master
            git pull

    What do we need to store? 
    What do we know from the instructions?

    DATA NEEDED:
    1. Trip starts on 03/01
    2. Distance to travel = 2000 miles
    3. Player starts with 500lbs of food
    4. Player starts with 5 health
    5. How far has the player moved
    6. Must be at end of trip on 12/31
    7. The list of months that have 31 days 
       is given in the implmementation details:
       MONTHS_WITH_31_DAYS = [1, 3, 5, 7, 8, 10, 12]
'''
import random

# Months with 31 days
MONTHS_WITH_31_DAYS = [1, 3, 5, 7, 8, 10, 12]
# How far is the total trip
total_trip_distance = 2000
# Current month/day
current_day = 1
current_month = 3
# Player information
player_name = ""
player_distance = 0

    What actions do we ned to take? 
    What do we know from the instructions?


    ACTIONS NEEDED: 
    1. Collect the users name.
    2. Get user input for a command:
        travel : moves you randomly between 30-60 miles and 
                 takes 3-7 days (random).
        rest   : increases health 1 level (up to 5 maximum) and 
                 takes 2-5 days (random).
        hunt   : adds 100 lbs of food and takes 2-5 days (random).
        status : lists food, health, distance traveled, and day.
        help   : lists all the commands.
        quit   : will end the game.
    
    Implementation details tell us
        - Create functions for all options a player can take
        - Create a function add_day which updates the day
        - Every day that passes, there should be a 5% chance 
          that the player loses 1 health.
        - Every day that passes, the player eats 5lbs of food
