## Details
Remember the game show (2_GameShow.md) program? Create this game again using lists and indexes. 

### New Rules
- Declare 5 prizes (prize0, prize1, prize2, etc at the top of your file), but store them all in a single list.
- User picks a number. (This will be the index into your list)
- Print the prize associated with the door the user picked.

# Example
```
Welcome to Mr. Zâ€™s game of fabulous prizes. Pick a number from 1 to 5:  3
Congratulations, you just won a brand new piece of paper!
