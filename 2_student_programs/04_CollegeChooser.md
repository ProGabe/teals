## Details
Create a quiz to help you choose which college you should go to (or another topic of your choice. See Example Below)! The program should ask the user a question and list four possible answers. If the student chooses the first answer, add 1 point to School[0]. If they choose the second answer add 1 point to School[1], and so on. At the end print out the schools and the scores for each school.

- Create a list of 4 options of colleges.
- Create a different list of four 0s, representing the user's votes so far.
- Create 3 questions. Each question should have four different answers. Each answer corresponds to the specific school option.
- At the end print off the 4 different schools and the score the user got for each of those schools.
