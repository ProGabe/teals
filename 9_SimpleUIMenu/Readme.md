# Computer Help

Project consists of two things
- Website
    - Already live (https://grecoe.z13.web.core.windows.net/)
    - As part of the project YOU have to fix this up with additional pages/content.
    - This is purely a static HTML site, but you will not have permission to update it.
- Python Application
    - Fully functional, but lacking any real topics.
    - You will need to understand what this code does.
        - You will need to write comments to explain WHAT the code is doing in great detail for your teacher to understand you really do know what is going on.
    - You will change some of the code when you do.
    - You will add in at least 10 topics for the tool to look for.

## helpconfig.json
This is the configuration file for the project.

We will discuss this and how it works.
