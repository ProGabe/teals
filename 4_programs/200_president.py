    This is a simple program that lets a user know if they can be president. 
    The rules are:

    1. Must be over 35 years old
    2. Must have lived in the US for 14 years
    3. Must be a citizen

    This shows how to get input from the user and cast it to the types we want
    then compare the input with the rules to make a determination. 

    This program works on topics covered elsewhere in this repository
