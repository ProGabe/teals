    Once you get comfortable with functions you will use them everywhere! Becoming
    proficient with creating functions is crucial to your programming skills.

    For this section we'll introduce a new Python module called random. This module
    creates a psuedo random number generator as well as some other useful functions.
    The following questions will ask you to use this module:

        random.shuffle([list]) -> Randomizes the input list in place and returns nothing.
        random.randint(a,b) -> Return a number between a and b inclusive
'''
import random


'''
    1.  Write a function called myprint that takes no parameters and simply
        prints out any random string of your choosing.

        Call the function.
'''

'''
    2.  Write a function called sum that takes two parameters and returns the
        sum (addition) of the two parameters.

        Call the function.
'''

'''
    3.  Write a function called random_selection that takes a single parameter that
        is a list. The function should randomly choose a value from the list and return
        that value.

        Call the function.
'''
test_list = ["red", "white", "blue"]

'''
    4.  Write a function called random_shuffle that takes a single parameter that
        is an integer.

        The function should create a list of numbers that has as many members in it
        as defined by the single input parameter.

        Return the shuffled list.

        Call the function.
'''

'''
    5.  Write a function called multiple_return that takes no parameters.

        The function should return two items (whatever you want) to the caller as
        a tuple.

        Call the function and show how to use a multiple return by.
            1. Having multiple catch variables from the function
            2. Catching the return tuple and iterating those.
