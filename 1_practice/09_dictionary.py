    Practice with dictionaries!

    Because iterating dictionaries lends itself to the for loop, that is covered here as well. 
'''


'''
    Create a dictionary that will be used for the rest of this section. If you don't 
    remember, go back to 0_python\09_dictionary.py.
'''
test_dict = 

'''
    Write the code to add two more items to the dictionary. 
'''
print("1.")

'''
    Write the code to determine how many items are in test_dict
'''
print("2. test_dict is ", ?? , "in size")

'''
    Write the code to iterate over test_dict using a for loop and print
    out each key and value.
'''
print("3. test_dict is ", ?? , "in size")

'''
    What are the valid indexes into test_list to access, or change 
    a value in the list?
'''
print("4.")

'''
    How would you get a value from the dictionary with a key?
'''
print("5.")

'''
    Write the code to change the value of any item in your dictionary to "dog".
    Print out the dictionary to see if you changed the right item.
'''

print("6. Change a value - ", test_dict)

'''
    Write the code to remove any item from the dictionary. 
    Print out the dictionary.
'''

print("7. Remove an item - ", test_dict)
